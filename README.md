# XavierBerger Home Assistant Add-ons

My repository with Add-ons for the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Addons

- **MkDocs** - [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.  
  Start by reading the [introductory tutorial](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), then check the [User Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) for more information.

Further information about the add-ons can be found in their dedicated folders.

## Experimental

Even if officially published addons are tested and works on my Home Assistant Yellow, addons might not be stable at all. Use at your own risk!
